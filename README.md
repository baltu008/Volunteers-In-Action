Volunteers In Action
VIA is a project meant for teenagers in high school to create and find volunteer projects within their neighborhoods. These volunteer activities complete requirements for community service in order to graduate high school.The ultimate goal of this project is implement activites and share them with fellow students. 

The motivation behind the project:
High school students in Minnesota must perform 30 hours of community service between 9-12 grade in order to graduate. They are limited with regards to which acitivities they can participate in because of their age. Unfortunately, instead of gaining a wide range of experiences, they stick to the ones that allow teenagers, repeating again and again the same service projects. Our motivation is to give high school students variety in these opportunities and to give them the power to control and create these acitivities based on their interests and what they believe is important. 

How to use:
